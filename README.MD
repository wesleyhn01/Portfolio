## Planned Remake with Svelte

I'm excited to announce that I'm planning to completely rebuild this portfolio using Svelte! Here's what I'm looking forward to:

- Leveraging Svelte's component-based architecture for better code organization
- Utilizing Svelte's reactive declarations for smoother state management
- Implementing smooth transitions and animations with Svelte's built-in transition system
- Exploring SvelteKit for server-side rendering and routing
- Improving overall performance and load times
- Adding more interactive and dynamic elements to showcase my projects

This remake will not only improve the user experience of my portfolio but also demonstrate my growing skills in modern web development frameworks.
